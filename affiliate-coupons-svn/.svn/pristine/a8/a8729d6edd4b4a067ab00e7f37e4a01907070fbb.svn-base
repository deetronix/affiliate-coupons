## [4.11]

    - Add `object_id` property to the meta box object. Used to connect the meta box to the post object. Not heavily used yet.
    - Add RWMB_Meta_Box_Registry and RWMB_Field_Registry to store all registered meta boxes and fields. Used to future access these objects. Use internally only. 3rd-party code should not use it as it's still experimental and can change in the future.
    - Deprecated RWMB_Core::get_meta_boxes() due to the meta box registry above. This function was made for internally use only. 3rd-party code should not rely on it.
